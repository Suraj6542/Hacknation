## About Project
This project is based upon iot and sensors where we are using the PH sensor and the soil moisture sensor. Basically we are making a soil testing kit and going to connect it into an app so that the farmers can get compared results of soil nutrients within few minutes and by using our app's guideline the farmer can get the optimum production from farming fiels







**Tech stack**:
we connected the PH sensor with the arduino and got the results of PH in water as refrence.
We showed the data of pH sensor on node-red Dashboard which showed the comparison data of pH value.


 

## Use Cases of your project 
we used a ph sensor and integrate it with the arduino uno
